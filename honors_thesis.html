<p>
My undergraduate honors thesis focused on further investigating Noun (head) movement in
English, a somewhat controversial proposal (partially due to the covert nature of that
movement in English, unlike in Romance languages). Below is the abstract that I submitted to
<a href="https://www.caurs.com/">CAURS 2024</a>, and I'd be happy to provide the full thesis on request.

<h1>Investigating N-Movement in English: Presence and Proposals</h1>
<h2>Adam Leif and Masaya Yoshida</h2>
<p>
  It has been suggested that the Noun (N) heads of NPs in English can move and that N may land in the
  “little n” (n) head of an nP, a proposed functional phrase between Determiner Phrase (DP) and NP.
  However, other N-movement proposals suggest that N may instead move elsewhere. Additionally, there is
  little experimental evidence of N-movement in English, where, unlike in Romance languages, such movement
  would occur covertly — and, therefore, be difficult to observe. If N-movement does occur in English, it
  should be sensitive to movement constraints, like the Head Movement Constraint and Coordinate Structure
  Constraint. To investigate whether this is the case, we introduce the pseudo-Prepositional Phrase (PP)
  coordination construction (e.g. “I want to distinguish the fear<sub>1</sub> of John<sub>2</sub> t<sub>1</sub>
  of Mary and of David<sub>3</sub> t<sub>1</sub> of Sarah”), a potential N-movement structure where the N
  heads of coordinated NPs move across-the-board (ATB) to the same hierarchically higher position. We utilize
  this construction in a formal acceptability rating experiment, manipulating CONNECTIVE (and vs. from) and
  GAP (present vs. absent) and anticipating similarly high ratings in both gap-absent cases (since neither
  involves movement that potentially violates movement constraints). If ATB-N-movement occurs in English,
  and-gap should be rated lower than the gap-absent cases but higher than from-gap: the former observes HMC
  and CSC while the latter violates them. We found a significant effect of GAP (t = 8.2456) and GAP x CONNECTIVE
  (t = -3.8954), demonstrating that the pseudo-PP coordination construction involves ATB-N-movement. Through
  further analysis, we show that the moved N lands in n: but, interestingly, this does not appropriately
  describe
  how other noun types, like non-verb-derived light (e.g. someone) and heavy nouns (e.g. candidate), move. As
  such, we suggest that non-verb-derived nouns are treated differently than verb-derived ones, potentially
  according to other previous N-movement proposals.
