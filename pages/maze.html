<h1>What is the maze task?</h1>
<p>
    Maze is an online (real-time), word-by-word reading task where participants are shown a pair of words -- 
    a target and a distractor -- and asked to choose the one that appropriately continues the sentence. There 
    are two common variants: L(exicality)-Maze, where a real word and a nonce word are shown, and the subject 
    identifies the valid word; and G(rammaticality)-Maze, only one of two real words continues the 
    sentence/maintains the grammaticality of the sentence. You can read more about the maze task 
    <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/BRM.41.1.163">here</a>, and see some information about how it compares 
    to other online measures in <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10936-011-9179-x">this paper</a>.

    Below is a demo of both kinds of maze task. The instructions aren't tuned specifically
    for L-/G-maze, but they should essentially fit with what a subject would normally see.
