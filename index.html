  Hi there, I'm Adam Leif, a PhD student in UCLA's Department of Linguistics. I'm interested
  in syntax, computational linguistics, and sentence processing. At the moment, I'm working on a 
  treatment of my <a href="honors_thesis.html">honors thesis</a> from my senior year for publication, 
  which includes some additional experimentation and theoretical considerations. I'm also working 
  with <a href="https://timhunter.humspace.ucla.edu/">Tim Hunter</a> on a project that implements
  Agree as an FSTA, with the ultimate goal being to analyze and compare various theories (and levels 
  of complexity) of Agree. As an undergraduate at Northwestern University, I was advised by both 
  <a href="https://robvoigt.faculty.ucdavis.edu/">Rob Voigt</a> and
  <a href="https://www.icrea.cat/community/icreas/31698/masaya-yoshida/">Masaya Yoshida</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Outside of my academic pursuits, I'm a big TTRPG fan (I've participated in numerous campaigns
  in numerous systems), a medium-time board game enjoyer, a mediocre Magic: The Gathering drafter,
  and a passable video game player. I also take
  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/adamleifphotography/">pictures</a> sometimes.
