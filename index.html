  Hi there, I'm Adam Leif, a PhD student in UCLA's Department of Linguistics. I'm interested
  in syntax, computational linguistics, and sentence processing. At the moment, I'm working on a 
  treatment of my <a href="honors_thesis.html">honors thesis</a> from my senior year with 
  <a href="https://www.icrea.cat/community/icreas/31698/masaya-yoshida/">Masaya Yoshida</a> for 
  publication, which includes some additional experimentation and theoretical considerations. I'm 
  also doing my Master's (advised by <a href="https://timhunter.humspace.ucla.edu/">Tim Hunter</a>, 
  <a href="https://yuan.humspace.ucla.edu/">Michelle Yuan</a>, and 
  <a href="https://stefankeine.com/">Stefan Keine</a>), which seeks to implement Agree (as it exists
  according to various authors) in a rigid, computational way. My hopeful goals are that this will 
  allow me to analyze, compare, and make interesting typological predictions about those models. 
</p>

  As an undergraduate at Northwestern University, I was advised by and worked with both 
  <a href="https://robvoigt.faculty.ucdavis.edu/">Rob Voigt</a> and Masaya Yoshida.

  Outside of my academic pursuits, I'm a big TTRPG fan, a medium-time board game enjoyer, and 
  a passable video game player. I also take 
  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/adamleifphotography/">pictures</a> sometimes.
