  Hi there, I'm Adam Leif, a PhD student in UCLA's Department of Linguistics. I'm interested
  in syntax and sentence processing, with a secondary focus on computational linguistics. At
  the moment, I'm working on a treatment of my <a href="honors_thesis.html">honors thesis</a> 
  from last year for publication, which includes some additional experimentation and theoretical 
  considerations. While I don't currently have any official advisors, I had the privilege of 
  being advised by <a href="https://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/robvoigt/">Rob Voigt</a> and
  <a href="https://www.icrea.cat/community/icreas/31698/masaya-yoshida/">Masaya Yoshida</a> during my time as 
  an undergraduate at Northwestern (and I credit them with my decision to pursue my PhD).
</p>
<p>
  Outside of my academic pursuits, I'm a big TTRPG fan (I've participated in numerous campaigns
  in numerous systems), a medium-time board game enjoyer, a mediocre Magic: The Gathering drafter,
  and a passable video game player. I also take
  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/adamleifphotography/">pictures</a> sometimes.
