          Hi there, I'm Adam Leif, a PhD student in UCLA's Department of Linguistics. I'm interested
          in syntax and sentence processing, with a secondary focus on computational linguistics. At
          the moment, I'm not particularly involved in research -- other than doing a treatment of my
          <a href="honors_thesis.html">honors thesis</a> from last year for publication,
          which includes some additional experimentation. While I don't currently have any official 
          advisors, I had the privilege of being advised by 
          <a href="https://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/robvoigt/">Rob Voigt</a> and 
          <a href="https://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/myo507/">Masaya Yoshida</a> 
          during my time as an undergraduate at Northwestern (and I credit them with my decision to 
          pursue my PhD).
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of my academic pursuits, I'm a big TTRPG fan (I've participated in numerous campaigns 
          in numerous systems), a medium-time board game enjoyer, a mediocre Magic: The Gathering drafter, 
          and a passable video game player. I also take 
          <a href="https://www.instagram.com/adamleifphotography/">pictures</a> sometimes.
